## Decision Trees and Random Forests Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** for classification using the Heart Disease dataset.

---

### 📑 Overview

This task focuses on understanding and implementing tree-based machine learning models for classification. The goal was to:
- Train and visualize a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Analyze overfitting by controlling tree depth
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier** and compare its accuracy
- Interpret feature importances
- Evaluate models using cross-validation
- Visualize correlation heatmap and confusion matrix

---

### 🛠️ What I Did:
- Trained and visualized a Decision Tree classifier
- Analyzed overfitting by controlling tree depth
- Trained a Random Forest model and compared accuracy
- Interpreted feature importances
- Evaluated models using cross-validation
- Visualized correlation heatmap and confusion matrix

### 🏗️ Tools Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab
